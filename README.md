## Epilepsy Warning

Some people may be at risk of epileptic seizures caused by visual effects associated with flickering in the Affective Rings game. Even people who have never experienced such attacks may have undiagnosed medical conditions that can cause visual epileptic attacks when watching or using the "Affective Rings" game.
    
The characteristic symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, twitching of the eyelids or face muscles, twitching or numbness of the limbs, confusion and temporary loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, epileptic seizures can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions, which create the risk of serious injury from falling or hitting objects from your surroundings.
    
If symptoms occur, stop the game immediately and contact your doctor. Children should only play under the supervision of parents watching them, because it is children and adolescents who are most at risk of such symptoms.

The risk of epileptic seizures can be reduced by taking precautions:
- Refrain from playing the game in a state of tiredness or sleeplessness
- Do not sit too close to the screen
- Ensure that the room is well lit
- Play in short sessions lasting several minutes
- If your family has had symptoms of epilepsy, consult a doctor

## Additional Information

Project prepared for short sessions during which difficulty level would adjust to the player's GSR changes (thanks to biophysiological data acquisition with usage of BITalino (r)evolution Board Kit).  This goal comes before quality of gameplay experience (esp. amount of lives, amount of rings and pulsating visual effects may not be optimal for normal sessions). Game begins with short (30s) video for baseline establishment purposes.
